**Phil Peters (he/him) - Senior Software Development Lead**
<hr/>

This page is intended to help others understand what it might be like to work with me, especially people who haven’t worked with me before.

It’s also a well-intentioned effort at building some trust by being intentionally vulnerable, and to share my ideas of a good working relationship to reduce the anxiety of people who might be on my team.

## 👨🏻‍💻 About me

My name is Phil and I live on the edge of the New Forest on the South Coast of England. I'm married to Emma, together we have 2 cats, Maggie & Matilda. I enjoy travelling, and I love finding out new information; espcially about History. Lately, I've been learning to play piano - I'm a big lover of musical theatre 🎭 so I'm very happy to be able to start learning some songs from my favourite shows. 

When it comes to sport I'm massively into the NFL 🏈 and follow the 4 time Super Bowl Champions 🏆🏆🏆 - The Kansas City Chiefs 🔴🟡. If we have any virtual meetings together you may spot subtle clues to my KC fanatacism. If you follow any other NFL team come talk to me about them and I'll tell you why you're wrong 😉. 

The [Specsavers 👓 behaviour](https://join.specsavers.com/uk/experience-specsavers/#:~:text=Our%20values%20and%20behaviours) that resonates with me the most is 🏃🏻‍♂️ _Courageous_ - because I like working with colleagues, driving change to make colleagues and customer's lives better through technology. 

Professionally I'm a DevOps advocate and have seen the value that employing DevOps methodologies and behaviours can bring. I automate everything and use code to solve solutions when it makes sense. I am always open to conversations about improving efficiencies be they personal, professional, engineering focussed or otherwise.  

## 🤝 How you can help me

- I talk very fast, I try to manage this as best I can. If I say something too fast for you please just ask me to repeat myself more slowly and I'll happily do so. 
- I value all types of feedback and I'm always eager to learn and improve myself. I prefer to receive negative feedback in a 1:1 setting. 
- I prefer to have a meeting agenda/outline prior to the call so I know roughly what to expect. Not knowing what to expect can lead me to make assumptions which are incorrect.
- I suffer from Tinnitus which can affect my concentration, if you see my in the office with my headphones 🎧 on please feel free to speak with me, if I'm on a call I'll let you know. I use music to manage the ringing! 
- I prefer to have information that is subject to change rather than leaving that information out. Otherwise I might make assumptions that are not correct.
- I am confident in challenging things I care deeply about however respect hierarchy, so tell me when I'm challenging things not in my remit to change.

## 💼 My working style

- I love asking "Why?" it motivates me and helps me be effective when I understand the problem we are trying to solve 
- I prefer to know the problem rather than the solution. Even if a solution has been decided please take me on the journey to understand the problem.
- I value simple documentation, and appreciate the effort that goes into clear communication. I work well when presented with a diagram, and I find it easier to get information from a spoken conversation than a text based format. 
- I am really passionate about code, good practice and using technology to solve problems. 
- I use messaging asynchronously, if I ask for something I'll try and include all the information in my message so you're empowered to respond when is convinient for you

## ⚖  Scale of Conviction
- Sometimes, I use a rating system out of 10 to communicate how strongly held I am of my opinion. 

    - 1 - Very loosely held, offering an opinion but happy to be overruled 
    - ... 
    - 10 - I really care about this and will likely be unwilling to compromise 

For example I might say _I think we should go for coffee rather than tea, I'm 3/10 on this_ 


## 🤔 What I assume about others

- We both want the best, I’m a huge believer in win-win situations, and I’m willing to compromise. 
- If something is wrong, you are comfortable to let me know. If no one says anything, I will assume you are okay with it. 


## 💬 Communicating with me

- My typical working hours are: 
    - **Mon** - 08:30 - 17:00 🏠
    - **Tue** - 07:30 - 17:00 🏢
    - **Wed** - 08:30 - 17:30 🏢
    - **Thu** - 07:30 - 17:00 🏢
    - **Fri** - 08:30 - 17:00 🏠
    
I'm okay with meeting outside my working hours but I prefer having later meetings than waking up early for one. 
- I prefer **in person** 🤝 meetings on Tuesdays, Wednesday and Thursdays as I am in the office 🏢. 
- I prefer **virtual** 💻 meetings on Monday and Fridays as I am at home 🏡.
- I much prefer using Instant Messanger over Email so please get me on Teams.
- I may sometimes work outside normal working hours, if you get an email from me outside your standard working hours there is no expectation from me to reply immediately. 

## 💪 Strengths

- I have quite a vivid imagination that allows me to think of interesting solutions to complex problems
- I consider myself easy going and easy to communicate with, I'm always happy to have a chat and undertstand your point of view before offering my own


## 👎 Weaknesses

- Sometimes my passion can leave me blind to the problem we're trying to solve. If you see this affecting my work please do tell me
