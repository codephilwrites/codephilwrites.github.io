# 👋🏻 **Phil Peters (he/him) - Senior Software Development Lead**



This is a living document that aims to reduce ambiguity, build trust, and make it easier to work with me. It’s part guide, part open door – especially useful if you’re new to working with me or if we’re trying to collaborate more deeply. I'm sharing this to be transparent, but also to make space for you to do the same.

## 👨🏻‍💻 About Me

I’m Phil – a Senior Engineering Lead at Specsavers and I am based on the edge of the New Forest. I live with my wife Emma and our two cats, Maggie and Matilda. I love learning, especially about history, and I’ve recently started learning piano so I can play songs from my favourite musicals 🎭. If you want to talk about *Les Mis*, *Blood Brothers*, or anything Musicals – I’m in.

I’m also a die-hard Kansas City Chiefs fan 🔴🟡 you may spot subtle hints about this when I work from home!

Professionally, I advocate for *DevOps as a culture, not just a toolchain*. I’m focused on building great developer experiences, sustainable engineering practices, and enabling organisations to move fast without breaking things that matter. I care deeply about strategy, automation, and helping engineers do their best work.

The Specsavers behaviour I most identify with is **🏃🏻‍♂️ Courageous** – not just pushing for change, but helping others feel confident to come along for the ride.

## 🧑🏻‍💼 What I Do & How I Think

Right now, I’m contributing to the evolution of our engineering capability at Specsavers by shaping and supporting a long-term strategy for how we build and scale our software delivery. That includes influencing direction in areas such as:
- **Practice** (craft, community, consistency)
- **Value stream engineering** (optimising how we deliver end-to-end)
- **Core engineering** (standards, tools, environments)
- **Innovation** (time, space and sponsorship to explore ideas)
- **Governance and metrics** (because we can’t improve what we can’t see)

I care deeply about platform thinking, developer enablement, and how teams can balance autonomy with alignment. I try to zoom between strategic and tactical levels – one minute I’m talking about engineering operating models, the next I’m in the weeds of a CI/CD design.

## 🧭 My Leadership Philosophy

My leadership style is principle-led and outcome-oriented. I believe in creating clarity, removing friction, and enabling people to do their best work. I don’t believe in micromanagement – I trust people to own their outcomes. My role is to remove blockers, ask useful questions, and help us stay aligned to our mission and values.

---

## 🛠 How I Make Decisions

I prioritise long-term impact over short-term wins. I tend to ask, “Is this scalable?”, “Is it aligned with strategy?”, and “Who will this affect?” I value data but will act on conviction when needed. I’ll often gut-check big calls with peers or direct reports, even if the final call sits with me.

---

## 🔁 How I Give and Receive Feedback

- I give feedback with intent to help, not to judge.
- I’ll praise in public but give critique in private.
- If I don’t give feedback immediately, it’s not because I didn’t notice – I might just be choosing the right moment.
- If I ever give feedback that feels off – tell me. I’m always learning and improving.

---

## 🛣 What I'm Currently Focused On

- Aligning Specsavers’ engineering function to the Long-Term Framework
- Responsibility and Accountabiliy for technical delivery of the Retail Platform
- Accountability for technical delivery of the Clinical Platform
- Global oversight for technical alignment of Clincal and Retail platform supporting applications 
- Creating a DevEx strategy rooted in platform thinking
- Establishing practices and principles to scale engineering excellence

## 💼 My Working Style

- I love understanding the *why* behind the *what*. Bring me the context and I’ll help you to a solution.
- I prefer the problem over the solution – even if you’ve already picked a path, walk me through the decision.
- I like structured thinking but messy whiteboards – don’t be afraid to show half-formed ideas.
- I communicate best via diagrams, metaphors, and real-world parallels (NFL analogies likely).
- I favour asynchronous tools and clear, complete communication. I’ll try to give you everything you need in one message.
- I default to optimism and forward momentum, but I value dissent and devil’s advocacy.
- I sometimes use a **Conviction Scale (1–10)** ⚖️ to signal how strongly I feel about something. A “2” means I’ll go with the flow. A “9” means I care a *lot* and might be harder to sway. If I add `4/10` to a message or converstion this is me telling you how strong my conviction is. 

---

## 💬 Communication Preferences

- 🕒 My, typical, core working hours are:
  - **Mon**: 07:30 – 17:00 (Forum 5)🏢
  - **Tue**: 07:30 – 17:00 (Forum 5)🏢
  - **Wed**: 08:30 – 17:30 (Forum 5)🏢
  - **Thu**: 07:30 – 17:00 (Forum 5)🏢
  - **Fri**: 09:00 – 16:30 (Remote)🏠

- 📍 I prefer:
  - In-person meetings on Mon–Thu
  - Virtual meetings on Fri
  - Teams over email 
  - Late meetings over early ones
- ✈️ Once a month I work from La Villiaze, on Guernsey. Ask me when I'm next there and we can schedule some time. 

- 📧 If I message outside your hours, I don’t expect a response until you’re back online. I respect your boundaries and assume you’ll respect mine.

## 🔄 Working With Me When…

- **When I’m deep in strategy work**: I may be slower to respond in chat. A nudge is totally fine.
- **When something’s on fire**: I move quickly and may be more direct than usual. It’s not personal – just focus mode.
- **When I’m quiet**: I’m either thinking or processing something – feel free to check in.

---

## 🤝 How You Can Help Me

- I talk fast. If you need me to slow down or repeat something, just say so.
- I prefer feedback directly, and if it’s negative, a 1:1 is best.
- I appreciate agendas – uncertainty breeds assumptions.
- I live with tinnitus and often use music to help me focus. If I’m wearing headphones, tap me – I’ll let you know if I’m on a call.
- I’d rather know something that *might* change than not know it at all. I work better when I have the full picture, even if it’s messy.
- I challenge things I care about, but I value hierarchy. Let me know if I’m stepping outside my lane – I’ll appreciate the redirect.

---

## 🧠 What I Assume About Others

- We both want to make things better – and we’ll get further by working together.
- You’ll let me know if something’s off – silence = consent in my book, so challenge me if needed.
- You have good intent, even if your message lands awkwardly – I’ll try to offer the same grace.

---

## 💪 Strengths

- I’ve got a vivid imagination – good for innovation, bad for sticking to PowerPoint templates.
- I’m a connector – I love cross-pollinating ideas across teams and disciplines.
- I bring clarity and structure to chaos, but I’m happy operating in ambiguity to find a clarity.
- I can articulate a vision *and* help people rally around it.

---

## 👎 Weaknesses

- I can become so passionate about a direction that I forget to revalidate the destination. Nudge me if that happens.
- I sometimes fixate on “the better way” at the cost of “the good enough for now”.
- I dislike inefficiency so much that I occasionally jump ahead of a process. Call me out if that affects team alignment.
