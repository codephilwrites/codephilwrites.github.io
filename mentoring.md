This is a living document that aims to reduce ambiguity, build trust, and make it easier to work with me. It’s part guide, part open door - especially useful if you’re new to working with me or if we’re trying to collaborate more deeply. I'm sharing this to be transparent, but also to make space for you to do the same.

Hi! 

First of all, congratulations on reaching your final year - that’s no small achievement. I’m really pleased to be your mentor as part of this year’s scheme, and I’m looking forward to getting to know you, understanding your goals, and helping you take confident steps towards your first role after university. 

I’ve put together this document to outline what you can expect from our mentoring relationship and how we’ll work together over the coming months. Think of it as a starting point rather than a rulebook, we’ll adapt things as we go, based on what’s most helpful for you. 

I’m really looking forward to the journey ahead.

## 🧔🏻‍♂️ A Bit About Me 

 I studied Primary Education at the University of Winchester and now work in software engineering, leading engineering strategy and delivery as Head of Software Engineering at Specsavers. I graduated from university in 2015 after making the decision not to continue into the teaching profession.  

 I’ve spent the past few years mentoring students as they transition from university into the world of work; helping them build confidence, clarity, and momentum. I’ve also hired and coached engineers at all stages of their careers, so I know what early career journeys can look like (including the messy bits!). 

As a mentor, my role is to ask questions, provide feedback, and assist you in considering possible next steps in a supportive manner. Whether you have a plan or absolutely no idea what comes next, that’s completely okay. I’ll support you in finding your own path, not someone else’s idea of the “right” one. 

This document outlines what you can expect from me, how we’ll work together, and some areas we might explore - from CVs and interviews to how to figure out what actually excites you. We’ll adapt it based on what you need most. 

### 💭 How I Think, Work and Communicate 

Everyone works a little differently, so here’s a quick snapshot of how I operate  -  just to help you know what to expect. 

- I value clarity. I’d rather share information early (even if it’s still evolving) than leave you guessing. 

- I talk quickly but listen carefully. Don’t hesitate to pause me, ask questions, or slow things down  -  mentoring should be a two-way conversation. 

- I like structure. I usually come to sessions with a loose plan or agenda, but we’ll adapt it based on what’s most useful for you on the day. 

- I can be quite upfront. Sometimes I’ll be direct in how I give feedback or share an opinion  -  it always comes from a place of wanting to help. If that’s not your style, please tell me and help me adjust. 

- I’m feedback-friendly. If something isn’t working for you, or you’d prefer a different approach, say so  -  I’ll always appreciate the honesty. 

- I’m here to empower, not instruct. My goal is to help you build confidence in your own judgement, not to give you all the answers. 

 

🤝 What You Can Expect From Me 

As your mentor, I’m here to support you as you take steps towards your first role after university. Here's what you can expect from me during our time working together: 

#### Honest, constructive feedback 
I’ll give you open, practical advice - whether we’re reviewing your CV, prepping for interviews, or exploring different roles and sectors. Take what I say as advice not instruction, I’m a sounding board to share ideas but I may not always be right.  

#### A safe, judgement-free space 
You don’t need to have everything figured out. I’ll never expect you to have all the answers; we’ll work through things together at your pace. 

#### Guidance from experience 
I’ll draw on my own career journey (which has been far from linear) and my experience mentoring, hiring, and leading teams. I’ll share what I’ve learned; and what I wish I’d known at your stage. 

#### Support tailored to you 
Everyone’s needs are different. Whether you want help exploring options, preparing applications, or building confidence, I’ll adapt how we work based on what’s most useful to you. 

#### Consistency and availability 
I’ll be clear about how and when you can contact me. I’ll stick to any commitments we make, and I’ll always respect your time. 

## 🙌 What I Hope From You 

For this mentoring relationship to be most useful, here’s what I’d appreciate from your side: 

#### Be open and honest 
Share your goals, challenges, interests and uncertainties. The more I understand what matters to you, the better I can support you. 

#### Take ownership 
This is your journey. I’ll guide and support, but the direction and momentum come from you. Come to our sessions with questions, reflections or topics you want to explore. 

#### Be proactive 
If you want feedback on something, practice an interview, or talk through options, let me know. I’m here to help, and the more you ask, the more you’ll get from our time together. 

#### Respect our time 
Life gets busy, but please give notice if you need to reschedule, and let me know if anything’s changed. I’ll always endeavour do the same for you. 

#### Stay curious 
Be willing to explore paths you hadn’t considered and reflect on what energises or frustrates you. Sometimes the most valuable insights come from unexpected places. 

## 📆 Our First Session 

Our first meeting is a chance for us to get to know each other and lay the foundations for how we’ll work together. There’s no pressure to come with all the answers  -  this is about starting a conversation. 

What We’ll Cover: 

- Introductions and background - a bit about you, your course, interests, and any thoughts (or worries) about the future 

- What you’re hoping to get from mentoring 

- How and when we’ll meet going forward 

- A quick look at your current CV or LinkedIn (if you’ve got one - no worries if not) 

- Any early questions you’ve got about job hunting, applications, or the industry you’re interested in 

What to Prepare: 

- A copy of your CV (drafts are fine) 

- Any links to your online presence (e.g. LinkedIn, portfolio) 

- A rough idea of what you want to get out of mentoring 

- Questions! Nothing is too small, too vague or too obvious 

- We’ll keep things relaxed, this isn’t an interview, and there are no wrong answers. It’s just the start of a conversation that we’ll build on in the months ahead.

### 📣 Keeping in Touch 

- Staying in regular contact helps us make the most of this mentoring opportunity, and I’ll keep things as flexible and low-pressure as possible. 

#### How We’ll Communicate 

- Primary method: Email or Microsoft Teams (depending on what suits you best) 

- Catch-ups: We’ll aim to check in roughly once a month, but we can adapt that depending on your schedule and what you need 

- Between sessions: Feel free to drop me a message if something comes up - a quick question, a job application, or something you want to talk through 

#### Booking Time 

- I’ll share a link or suggest times so you can book in when it suits you 

- We can meet via video call, phone, or in person if you’re nearby - whichever works best for you 

- A Note on Boundaries 

- Everything we discuss is confidential, unless there’s something I legally or ethically need to raise (e.g. safety concerns) 

- If I ever don’t know the answer, I’ll be honest  -  and I’ll try to point you in the right direction 

## 💬 Advice From a Previous Mentee 

Every mentoring relationship is a bit different but hearing from someone who’s been through the process can be helpful. 
Here’s some advice shared by one of my previous mentees who recently started her first role after graduating, reflecting on her experience and what she learned along the way: 

“When I started the process, I had just been rejected from what I thought might be a dream job. I would say to my past self that there are so many fulfilling and interesting jobs, some you may have never heard of, like the role I have now. You will find that many different jobs have elements of the kind of work you want to do so stay open to new things.” 

“Try to see every application as a learning opportunity, even if it ends in rejection.” 

“Try every bit of advice from the careers team and your mentor because they know what they're talking about. It can be challenging taking on feedback but it's so important because of how competitive certain industries can be.” 

“Alongside mentorship, I booked careers appointments for mock interviews and looking over applications. I talked to my programme leader because I was applying for a job related to higher education. I have been signed up to the careers newsletter since first year.” 

“A rough estimate would be between 2 and 3 hours when I was making my initial cover letter, CV and set of answers. This includes asking for feedback and making edits. Once this was done, applications probably took something between 1 and 2 hours.” 

“From the start I was quite flexible about where I would be willing to go for work. I tried not to get too attached to being in a certain place so I always felt like there would be options. I believed that I would end up in the right role eventually and that the right place would want to have me.” 

“The scheme is an invaluable resource at the university; one of the best decisions I have made. Don't give up and just make the most of the experience. It's rare to have someone committed to finding you a job and helping you to make strong applications, so get what you can from it.”
